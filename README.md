# MVNM
Maximal Variance Node Merging

 converts a channel level network into a region-level network using MVNM

inputs

adj_train -- a 3D channel-level adjacenecy matrix of causal networks of size DxDxN where D is the number of channels/nodes and N is the number of  networks

adj_val -- is a validation set of networks that use the training set's PCA coeffciceints to apply MVNM

TargetElectrodes -- region information a cell array where each entry is an array with channel indices that belong to the same region

number of cells/rows in TargetElectrodes is the number of regions 

outputs

adj_region_train -- region level networks training data

adj_region_val -- region level networks validation data
